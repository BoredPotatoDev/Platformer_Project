# LEVEL 5.5 TRUE ENDING
- achievable only when every chip is collected
- It is a long level where the player will see these phrases: 
- What you are experiencing is normal.
- Denial of what has happened. 
- The Anger that you lashed out on others. 
- The time you Bargained for everything to comeback. 
- When you drowned in all your sorrows. 
- But learn to accept the reality. We will still be here waiting for you. The emotions may still linger but never forget that there are people here waiting to help you. 

- At the end there will be a door 
- After entering the door show the last message:
- You are not alone.
